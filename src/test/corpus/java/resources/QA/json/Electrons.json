    "query":"What kind of particles are electrons?",
    "answer":"Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because electrons have no known components or substructure"

    "query":"Who gave electrons their name?",
    "answer":"British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical properties of atoms in 1838; Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897"
