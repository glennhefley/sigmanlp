The average North American driver travels 12,000 miles per year. In order to get the maximum life out of an automobile, you must provide it with proper maintenance. Proper maintenance can reduce air pollution, extend the value of the vehicle, save on fuel bills, prevent breakdowns, and lead to better performance. You should change the oil in all of your vehicles every 3,000 miles. Whenever you change the oil you should also change the oil filter. Oil filters remove dirt and debris from oil. As the car runs the oil filter becomes clogged with excess debris from the oil. In order for an engine to run it also requires air. This air must be filtered to stop dirt from damaging the engine. Due to the sheer heat of combustion, car engines become very hot. Antifreeze is used as a coolant in for your vehicle system. This coolant should be replaced every two years. By doing this you extend the life of your radiator. Other fluids that require maintenance at 60,000 miles and include brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid. The use of properly inflated and well maintained tires is critical. The tire that holds the car to the road is your first line of safety. Tires usually have a life expectancy dictated by the manufacturer. It is recommended that you follow this life expectancy which usually averages 30,000 miles. A vehicle should be driven properly by not exerting extra stress. Extra stress can lead to overheating. Overheating is the prime cause of premature life of belts, gaskets, hoses, and seals. If any of these parts become a problem it is a much better idea to replace the part than to repair it.
