Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid catarrhine primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia and distinguished by a wide degree of freedom at the shoulder joint indicating the influence ofbrachiation. There are two main branches the gibbons, or lesser apes and the hominids, or great apes. Lesser apes (Hylobatidae) include four genera and sixteen species of gibbon, including the Lar gibbon, and the siamang, all native to Asia. They are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground. They have lighter bodies and smaller social groups than great apes. The Hominidae include orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. Alternatively, the family is collectively described as the great apes. There are two extant species in the orangutan genus (Pongo), two species in the gorilla genus (Gorilla), two species in the chimpanzee genus (Pan), and a single extant species Homo sapiens in the human genus (Homo). Members of the superfamily are called hominoids (not to be confused with the family of hominids great apes, the subfamily of hominines, the tribe of hominins aka the human clade, or the subtribe of hominans). Some or all hominoids are also called apes. However, the term ape is used in several different senses. It has been used as a synonym for monkey or for any tailless primate with a humanlike appearance. Thus the Barbary macaque, a kind of monkey, is popularly called the Barbary ape to indicate its lack of a tail. Biologists have used the term ape to mean a member of the superfamily Hominoidea other than humans, or more recently to mean all members of the superfamily Hominoidea, so that ape becomes another word for hominoid. Except for gorillas and humans, hominoids are agile climbers of trees. Their diet is best described as frugivorous and folivorous, consisting mainly of fruit, nuts, seeds, including grass seeds, and in some cases other animals, either hunted or scavenged (or farmed solely in the case of humans), along with anything else available and easily digested. Most non-human hominoids are rare or endangered. The chief threat to most of the endangered species is loss of tropical rainforest habitat, though some populations are further imperiled by hunting for bush meat. The great apes of Africa are also currently facing threat from the Ebola virus. Currently considered to be the biggest threat to the survival of African apes it is responsible for the death of at least one third of the species since 1990.
