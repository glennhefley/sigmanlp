Bees are insects. Bees are special insects because they can fly! They can move through the air like an airplane! Bees can fly because they have wings. They use their wings to fly. Bees can fly fast. Bees can also fly slow. They can fly up and they can fly down. They need to fly to get to the flowers! Bees can have three colors. They can be yellow, red, and orange. All bees are black in some places. Bees have three main parts. They have a head. They have a body. And, they have a stinger. The stinger is used to defend against enemies. They also have six legs. They use their legs to stand and climb. They also use their legs to eat and collect pollen. Bees live in many places. They live in Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, North America, South America. The only continent that bees do not live on is Antarctica! I understand why they don’t live in Antarctica. It’s too cold! Most of the time, bees are nice to humans. If you do not bother them, they will not bother you. Have fun watching the bees this summer!
