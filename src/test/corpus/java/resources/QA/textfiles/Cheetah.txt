The Cheetah robot is the fastest legged robot in the World, surpassing 29 mph, a new land speed record for legged robots. The previous record was 13.1 mph, set in 1989 at MIT. The Cheetah robot has an articulated back that flexes back and forth on each step, increasing its stride and running speed, much like the animal does. The current version of the Cheetah robot runs on a high-speed treadmill in the laboratory where it is powered by an off-board hydraulic pump and uses a boom-like device to keep it running in the center of the treadmill. The next generation Cheetah robot, WildCat, is designed to operate untethered. WildCat recently entered initial testing and is scheduled for outdoor field testing later in 2013. Cheetah robot development is funded by DARPA's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation program. The U.S. military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) has the unique mission of protecting national security by maintaining technological superiority. If the new DARPA-funded "cheetah" robot is any indication, the agency is fulfilling this mission. This robot's movements are patterned after fast-running animals in nature, and it just set the record for the fastest legged robot in the world.  DARPA claims the use of robots in military operations has "already saves many lives and prevents thousands of other casualties." DARPA’s Maximum Mobility and Manipulation (M3) program is developing machines with many different potential military applications, but the intended uses for Cheetah have not been revealed.  Later this year a free-running prototype will be tested.
