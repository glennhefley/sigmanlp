Have you ever heard of the term, “Founding Fathers?” You may have wondered just who these men were and what they did to earn this title. Not everyone agrees on who should be given this title, but generally speaking, our Founding Fathers were the statesmen who worked to secure our independence from Great Britain in 1776. Our Founding Fathers founded our nation and designed our democratic form of government that still exists today, over 200 years later. The Founding Fathers wrote two very important documents from our history. The first was the Declaration of Independence, which declared our independence from Great Britain. The other was the United States Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, which formed our new government. No document has been more quoted, more discussed, or more imitated. Some of the more well-known Founding Fathers include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. The United States of America was founded because these men, along with others, believed that individuals had the right, as the Declaration of Independence states, to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
