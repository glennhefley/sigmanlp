A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with just a few thousand (103) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars, each orbiting their galaxy's own center of mass. Galaxies can be categorized according to their visual morphology, including elliptical, spiral, and irregular. Many galaxies are believed to have black holes at their active center. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times that of our Sun. Aristotle (384–322 BC), however, believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions. "The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 AD) was critical of this view, arguing that if the Milky Way is sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial.
