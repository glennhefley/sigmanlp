Hubble's law is the name for the observation in physical cosmology that:  objects observed in deep space (extragalactic space, ~10 megaparsecs or more) are found to have a Doppler shift interpretable as relative velocity away from the Earth; and that this Doppler-shift-measured velocity, of various galaxies receding from the Earth, is approximately proportional to their distance from the Earth for galaxies up to a few hundred megaparsecs away.
This is normally interpreted as a direct, physical observation of the expansion of the spatial volume of the observable universe.
The motion of astronomical objects due solely to this expansion is known as the Hubble flow.
Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the expanding space paradigm and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model.
Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the law was first derived from the General Relativity equations by Georges Lemaître in a 1927 article where he proposed that the Universe is expanding and suggested an estimated value of the rate of expansion, now called the Hubble constant.
Two years later Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of that law and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name.
The recession velocity of the objects was inferred from their redshifts, many measured earlier by Vesto Slipher (1917) and related to velocity by him.
