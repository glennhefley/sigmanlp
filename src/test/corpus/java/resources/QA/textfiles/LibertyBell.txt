The Liberty Bell, located in Pennsylvania, changed the world on July 8, 1776.
It rang out from the tower of Independence Hall.
It was used to summon the citizens to hear the first reading of the Declaration of Independence by Colonel John Nixon.
In the 1800s, the Liberty Bell became a symbol for ending slavery in America.
The Liberty Bell is famous for its large crack.
People don't know when the crack first appeared on the bell.
The crack got worse over time and people didn't want the bell to break apart.  
In order to preserve it, it was decided that the Liberty Bell should never again be used.
The bell hasn't been rung since Washington’s birthday in 1842.
