Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems.
It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals.
Not enough nutrients is called under nutrition while too much is called overnutrition.
Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein or micronutrients.
If undernutrition occurs during either pregnancy or before the age of two years of age it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development.
Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen.
People also often get infections and are frequently cold.
The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.
Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high quality food available to eat.
This is often related to high food prices and poverty.
There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies.
Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein).[3]
Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to increased demand, deficiencies become more common.
Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.
