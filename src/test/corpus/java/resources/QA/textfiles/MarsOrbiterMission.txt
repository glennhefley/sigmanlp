The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan  is a spacecraft orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014.
It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). 
It is India's first interplanetary mission and ISRO has become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. 
It is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit, and the first nation to do so on its first attempt.
The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (14:38 IST) on 5 November 2013. 
The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013. 
The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC). 
After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was successfully inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for design, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission. 
It carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about Mars to achieve its secondary, scientific objective.[24] 
The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bangalore with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Byalalu.
The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW or RAW) is the primary foreign intelligence agency of India.
It was created after the Sino-Indian War 1962 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 which exposed gaps in intelligence gathering undertaken by the Intelligence Bureau (which until then handled both domestic and foreign intelligence).
This convinced the Government of India that a specialised, independent agency was required for foreign intelligence gathering.[1]
Thus R&AW was formed in September 1968 under the guidance of its first Director, Rameshwar Nath Kao.
The primary function of R&AW is gathering foreign intelligence and counter-terrorism.
In addition, it is responsible for obtaining and analysing information about foreign governments, corporations and persons to advise Indian policymakers.[2][3][4]
It is also involved in the security of India's nuclear programme.[5][6]
Foreign analysts have often referred to R&AW as an effective organisation and one of the primary instruments of India's national power[7] and as one of the most fearsome intelligence agencies operating in the region.[8]
Headquartered in New Delhi, R&AW's current chief is Rajinder Khanna a 1978-batch RAS cadre officer.
