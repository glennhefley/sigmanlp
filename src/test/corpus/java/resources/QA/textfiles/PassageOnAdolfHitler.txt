Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (German: National sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter partei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and FÃ¼hrer (leader) of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As effective dictator of Nazi Germany, Hitler was at the centre of World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust. Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle").
