Humming birds are amazing little birds. They are the smallest of all birds and weigh less than even a penny. The Bee Humming bird, at barely more than two inches long, is the smallest bird in the world! Unlike most birds, humming birds have iridescent feathers. Iridescent feathers glitter and shine in the sun. Humming birds are often dazzling combinations of greens and reds or greens and blues. Others are violet, orange, golden, silver or other combinations only Mother Nature could dream up. All humming birds have long bills to insert into flowers. Some humming birds have special bills to fit in specific flowers. Humming birds are the only birds that can fly backwards. Humming birds are also unique among bird species in that they drink nectar from flowers. You can attract humming birds to your yard with special feeders that are filled with sugar water. These feeders are usually bright red in color because humming birds are attracted to red.
