Scientists and meteorologists are stunned at the result of scientific studies: warming and ice melting in the Arctic has been twice as fast as the rest of the globe over the last fifty years. The ice sea has shrunk by 20 in summer and 8 annually in winter over the past three decades.(the total loss is as big as Texas and Arizona combined). Snow on land has decreased by about 10 and temperature during the winter has risen as much as 5 to 7 degrees in Alaska and eastern Canada. They predict alarming development: Temperature could still rise further 13 degrees. The sea-level could climb and flood low areas. Itâ€™s already happened in the north of Alaska. There will be appalling repercussions. On sea two main species are expected to be on the brink of extinction: seals and white polar bears.
