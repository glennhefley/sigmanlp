The blue whale is the largest living animal to have ever lived on the planet Earth. Blue Whales are way larger than the largest dinosaur that ever lived. The largest Blue Whales can grow as large as 100 feet long, which is longer than three school buses put together! Even though blue whales are huge, they eat tiny creatures known as krill. Krill are tiny shrimp-like animals. The whale simply opens its mouth, fills it with krill and salt water, and filters the water out of plates in its mouth called baleen. The blue whale may eat over 8,000 pounds of krill in a single day!
