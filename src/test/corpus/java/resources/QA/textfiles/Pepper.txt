Pepper refers to a sparkling personality. We were looking for a name that expresses something unique, unexpected, impacting and easy to pronounce everywhere. In our mind, robots have no gender. But they are much more than a ³it², much more than just a product : they are an artificial species. But we noticed that depending on where you come from, people project Pepper to be a male of a female! In SoftBank shop Pepper can be considered as male.This robot has been created to make people happy to interact with. He's an emotional robot, not a functional robot for domestic use with dish washer or vacuum cleaner functionalities. Pepper will help people grow, enhance their life, facilitate relationship, he will have fun with them, give some services and connect them with the outside world. By creating new content and usages, the developer community will progressively sustain Pepper¹s growth. Humanoid shape facilitate communications and interaction : just speak and move! In a near future, you will be able to download new behaviors on the online Aldebaran Store in order to custom your robot as you wish. So, no need to be a developer or a geek to enjoy Pepper. Our objective is to enhance communication and interaction. We do not aim at duplicating live and humans. Therefore, bringing additional capacities which will facilitate interaction is not an issue. Today, the tablet is a way to display images, content or to express Pepper¹s inner life. Right now, Pepper is able to speak English, French, Japanese and Spanish. In the next few months, new languages will be available on the Aldebaran Store. Go and visit SoftBank shops! Or wait until the end of June, to discover Pepper in Paris. At SoftBank¹s, Pepper has entertainment functionalities and corresponding apps. But this is just for now. A huge business is open with the apps creation for humanoids robots. Pepper is not available yet. It will be introduced later for the consumer market. We are currently targeting the release in Japan first in February 2015.
