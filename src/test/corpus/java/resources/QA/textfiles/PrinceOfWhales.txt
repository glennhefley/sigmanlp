The Prince of Wales, the eldest son of The Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was born at Buckingham Palace at 9.14pm on November 14, 1948.
The Prince's mother was proclaimed Queen Elizabeth II at the age of 25, when her father, King George VI, died aged 56 on February 6, 1952. The Prince was four at his mother's Coronation, in Westminster Abbey on June 2, 1953
The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided that, instead of following the tradition and having a tutor at the Palace, their son should go to school to mix with children from non-royal backgrounds. Accordingly, on November 7, 1956, he started at Hill House school in west London.
The eldest child of Queen Elizabeth II, Charles was proclaimed Prince of Wales in 1958 and he is the heir to the British throne.
He served as a pilot and commander in the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976, and in 1981 he married Lady Diana Spencer in one of biggest royal weddings of the century.
The match proved a bad one; the couple separated in 1992 and they got divorced in 1996, the year before Diana's untimely death.
The Prince and Princess of Wales had two sons, Prince William who was born on June 21, 1982, and Prince Harry who was born on September 15, 1984.
 
Over these years, The Prince was developing a wide range of interests, including social and community issues, young people, the arts and natural environment, national heritage, religion and medicine. These interests can be seen in the long list of around 200 organisations of which he has been the president or the leader.
