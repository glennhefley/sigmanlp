RiSE is a robot that climbs vertical terrain such as walls, trees and fences.
RiSE uses feet with micro-claws to climb on textured surfaces.
RiSE changes posture to conform to the curvature of the climbing surface and its tail helps RiSE balance on steep ascents.
RiSE is 0.25 m long, weighs 2 kg, and travels 0.3 m/s. Each of RiSE 's six legs is powered by a pair of electric motors.
An onboard computer controls leg motion, manages communications, and services a variety of sensors, including joint position sensors, leg strain sensors and foot contact sensors.
Boston Dynamics developed RiSE in conjunction with researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Lewis and Clark University.
RiSE was funded by DARPA.
