Robo-dog Spot is the latest creation to be revealed by Google-owned robotics company, Boston Dynamics.
The latest four-legged creation announced via YouTube on Monday, is a sequel to cinder block-hurling automaton Big Dog.Weighing in at 160 pounds (73 kg), Spot might be a significantly smaller version than the hefty Big Dog.
Yet the automaton is a more agile version that jogs at a steady pace, and is surprisingly kick-resistant.
