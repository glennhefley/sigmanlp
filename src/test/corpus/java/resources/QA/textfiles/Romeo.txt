Romeo is a research robot created from the collaboration of laboratories and companies like Aldebaran.
This 140-cm humanoid robot is intended to deepen research on assistance for the elderly and those who have lost autonomy. Its height allows it to open doors, climb stairs, and even grab objects on a table. Started in January 2009, the ROMEO Project has four main complementary goals. They cover several major aspects in the development of robotics in France - A mechatronic platform and interactive, open, and scalable software, Robot Staff Assistant, surveillance and HMI functions, A robust platform for research and a Platform for a commercial robotics cluster.
The ROMEO Project was initiated as part of a Fond unique interministeriel (FUI) [interdepartmental fund] funded by the French department of competitiveness, industry, and services (DGCIS), the government of the Ile-de-France region, and the city of Paris under the auspices of Cap Digital. The project was initiated by Aldebaran Robotics.This first project was completed in December 2012. It brought together a dozen partners who form the backbone of the new ROMEO 2 Project: the continuation of development initiated in the ROMEO 1 Project. In four years, Romeo has gone from an ambitious vision of robotic assistance to a robot of measuring 1.4 m, known around the world; the first units have been ordered by French and European laboratories. The dynamic founder of the robotics subsidiary for French services, created by this FUI project, is already extending into new national and European partnerships.
